HOW TO USE
==================================================

I didn't want to use an ORM library due to simple fact,
I think it's an overextending of an already existing functionality.
Anyway I wanted to be able to build query using `database/sql` in a nice, easy way.
So I wrote this simple `query builder` that allows you to build and run your query.

For examples please check `examples` directory
